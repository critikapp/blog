Weâ€™re here to revolutionise feedback.

Giving feedback should not be a process of clunky surveys and customers who are tempted along by the chance of a $100 reward.

Feedback should be about customers saying exactly what they want to say. And about businesses getting great value from honest customer sentiment.

So Critik is here to change the party.

We reckon feedback looks more like a conversation than a questionnaire.

Our vision is to make it as easy as possible for customers to say exactly what they want. Then taking that data and getting it directly and privately to businesses so they can keep creating the amazing products and services that we want.

If we had to describe ourselves in one sentence, we would say that we love the crowd but we reckon the relationship is better.

Sign up for free at [critik.com](https://critik.com) and tell us what you think. Start your business on a journey towards great customer feedback with a 30-day trial.

We want your feedback and we want to know how we can be even better.

In fact we want to be the best.

For you. Whether you are a customer or a business. We're listening on Critik.
