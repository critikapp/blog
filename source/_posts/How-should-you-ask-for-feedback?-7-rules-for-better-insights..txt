It’s one of the most common questions we hear from businesses. How do I ask my customers and employees for feedback?

Anyone can write an email that asks people to fill out a short survey. But when you appreciate that survey fatigue syndrome (‘SFS’ - don’t Google it, we coined it) is entrenched in a large proportion of your customer base, the real challenge is to cut through the noise and activate a response. 

**Simply appealing to a sense of loyalty or offering a reward for feedback is not enough.** Consumers are used to feeling manipulated by large corporates that they know don’t really care about them. Your business has to stand out or you risk making customers even more resistant to speaking up. 

Appreciate that every request for feedback has a cost/ benefit association. If you ask for feedback well, you will create a culture of engagement and have to ask less often in the future. 

If on the other hand you ask poorly, you will just reinforce to customers that feedback is annoying, gradually grinding away any willingness to speak up except in relation to the most negative of experiences. Unfortunately this is a space to which we have all become accustomed.

So what should you say to your customers and employees to elicit the highest rate of response? Simply put, you need to **emphasise the personal nature and unique depth of relationship you have with your people.**

To put it in even simpler terms, the starting point is that human beings (you and me) are most real when having a face-to-face conversation with someone they like and trust. **You need to create as close to this space as possible.**

Part of this is about having a good relationship with your customers in the first place. You can’t overcome months of bad customer service with one cheerful email. But how you ask is definitely important. Feedback is an emotional response more than an intellectual exercise. So if you ask in a way that makes people feel good they will respond more often and give you better feedback. 

**Here are some top tips to help your customers and employees feel good about speaking up.** These apply whether you ask by email, text, messaging app or other platform.

**1.    Be conversational** -  Be professional but casual. People respond well to conversational, friendly language better than heavy prose. Just like having a coffee with your best friend.

**2.    Articulate a shared ‘why’** - Why does this feedback matter to both you (the business) and the customer or employee? Be relatable. Better to give one real reason for collecting feedback than a spiel about 'continuous improvement'. Your priority is to cut through survey fatigue, not to intellectually convince people about the value of feedback.

**3.    Use humour** - A little lightness or self-deprecation can engender goodwill and better responses.

**4.    Think about what people want to hear** - Address people by name ('Hi Matt', 'Dear Sarah') and don't use the words that emphasise structure (survey, process, form etc). Structure is the enemy of free flowing conversation. Similarly don't use overused catchphrases - (e.g. 'your opinion matters'). Your customers will see straight through this.
    
**5.    Demonstrate how feedback can and will bring about change** - Describe how feedback has led to improvement in the past. Identify one-two specific changes that have been made as a result of recent feedback. Even better throw in a short testimony - 'last month in response to member/ name's feedback we implemented change X'

**6.    Emphasise ‘recency’** - People give feedback in response to emotional triggers and so are most inclined to give feedback about recent experiences. Tap into this by specifying a time period (e.g. “have you get any ideas about how we could have improved our service in the last week”).

**7.    Say thank you:** Simple but critical. Don’t be gushy but make sure you thank people for their thoughts.
