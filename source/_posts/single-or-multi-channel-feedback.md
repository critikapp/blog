title: Single or multi-channel feedback?
date: June 24 2016

When we pitch Critik to potential clients, we get one question 99% of the time.

“I’m already doing customer feedback, why do I need another channel”.  We reply “Because Critik is awesome”.

They agree, we make the sell and then we crack a round of drinks to celebrate.

If only it was that easy.

Changing the way people give feedback is the easy part. But changing the way that people get feedback is difficult. Especially at a time of excess in social media and public forums mixed in with live chat, email and of course the classic helpdesk.

So when we suggest throwing Critik into the mix, it’s understandable that businesses question why.

Now of course there are good reasons why. Critik is super easy for customers, it channels feedback out of the public domain and it gives you a bunch of analytics to help make use of your data.

But the next question is whether you adopt Critik as your only feedback channel. Or whether you deploy it alongside existing channels that your customers use to speak up.

If you can you should offer Critik as your only feedback channel, you should. Straight up.

In the same way that limiting choices is good for sales, **focussing your feedback is likely to result in higher customer conversion**. It’s a fact demonstrated by established research from <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20(2000).pdf">Columbia University</a>, email marketing campaigns and ice-cream flavours (who eats bubble-gum flavour ice cream anyway?).

So when should you offer Critik as part of a multi-channel strategy?

- **Senior demographic:** Whoever said mature customers don’t use mobiles! Try using Critik next to paper forms and compare the results.
- **Established systems:** Switching to Critik too much of a disruption to your customer service management? Setup is simple and Critik can be trialled without significant risk to your other channels.
- **Personal context:** Is face to face customer interaction a regular part of your business? Critik is awesome but there’s nothing better than encouraging in-person feedback.

If you have an agile business, a Critik-only approach is the way to go. But if you need to, migrate your customers gradually.

Manage other communication through phone, email or social media, but listen to feedback on Critik. We guarantee your customers will respond.
