title: Feedback and gambling. Say what?

Getting customer feedback is like running a casino table. 

You stack the odds too low and the players get rich off your generosity and leave you in the red. You stack the odds too high and the players don’t play. A public review forum is an example of the former. A ten-page survey is the latter.

So how do you set up an attractive game for both sides?

As a business, every customer you email a survey or ask for a positive review conducts a cost/benefit analysis of your request. They stack up their own time and effort against their personal satisfaction of speaking up.

They also consider the odds of being listened to, the value of a reward you might promise them and likelihood their feedback will result in actual improvement to your business.

The starting point is that **customers perceive the odds as being weighted heavily against them**. Customers are asked for feedback all the time and are biased about the house. Fair or not, customers exaggerate the costs and minimise the benefits. 

The consequence as we all know is that it’s hard to get customers to speak up, especially to give neutral or positive feedback. If you are a business you have to work very hard to attract players to your table.

The fact is that many businesses concentrate so hard on trying to win the game (“what data do we need”) and forget they need customers to actually play.

It’s no surprise that customers find themselves wandering between tables wanting to play but never quite convinced any game is winnable. This is where the frustration and general malaise around giving feedback sets in.

At Critik, we are disrupting this process. Unlike many feedback platforms, we think the core question is not **“what data do we need”** but **“how do we set up an attractive game?”**

So if your business is new to Critik, here are the golden rules we we think make a good game:

• **Low effort wins every time.** It doesn't matter how much your customers love your business. Feedback must be easy. Must.

• **Make the reward easier to get, not just larger.** No one actually believes they are going to win the $10M jackpot on the slots.

• **The game is as important as the win**. Make giving feedback enjoyable and your customers will come back for another round.

• **Don’t bank on customer generosity.** Customers have a lot of other competing tables asking them to play. 

The irony is that if you concentrate on setting up an attractive game, you will get the data and customer engagement you want.
