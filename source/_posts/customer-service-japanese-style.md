title: How to do amazing customer service Japanese style
date: April 27 2016

Some of our Critik team travelled to Japan recently. It's hard not to be blown away by the incredible country, food and winter culture. But it's even harder not to be attracted to the way Japanese people treat their guests.

The Japanese have a way of surprising you as to just how 'guest-centric' they are.  The hospitality plays out when you're arriving at Narita airport, when you're boarding the Shinkansen or when you ordering the best ever ramen at a local watering hole. It also plays out in local homes - staying at a local guesthouse is more akin to staying with a family friend than at a commercial hotel.

CX analyst Ryan Hart blogged recently about the Japanese culture of omotenashi – the 'unobtrusive and respectful approach to guests that anticipates their needs, bestows respect and surprises them at every point in the service scenario'. Or in other words, 'to entertain a guest wholeheartedly'. This national culture of empathy causes Japanese companies to have incredible customer service, despite a comparative lack of rigorous CX methodology in Japanese business practice. Check out Hart's full blog [here](https://www.forrester.com/ryan-hart).

What this means for your business is that you don't need a complicated, multi-channel, consultant designed customer service strategy to build your customer base! Instead, win trust and loyalty by simply treating your customers like honoured guests. This is not breaking news – it's just recognising that relationships (not science or strategy) are still the real keys to building a great business.

The three fundamentals are to **treat your customers like a good friend**, to **anticipate what your customers want** and to have **heart-to-heart conversations** with your customers. We unashamedly think Critik is the best C2B communication channel out there to help you do all three. But whether you use Critik, email or the humble telegram, the priority is to replicate as close as possible a *personal friendship with your customers*.

So how to kick off your winning omotenashi style customer engagement? Don’t stress about getting your strategy right. Just find the best way to connect, be a really good person and make sure your employees do the same. The rest is up to your customers.
